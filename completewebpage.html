<h1>Mother's Day</h1>
<p>In India, Mother's Day is observed on the second Sunday of May every year. This year, we will mark the celebrations for Mother's Day on May 8. </p>
<p>Mother’s Day is a celebration for mothers all over the world. The tireless contribution of mothers towards their family and many other sacrifices makes them worthy of this and much more.

Mother’s Day was first celebrated in the US in 1908. A woman named Anna Jarvis commemorates this day to honour her mother. Anna had a memorial for her mother, Ann Reese Jarvis, who was a peace activist . Anna wanted to honour her mother because she believed that a mother is ‘the person who has done more for you than anyone in the world’.</p>
